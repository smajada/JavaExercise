# JavaExercise

## Part I
Prepare a menu that chooses how to execute the different exercises that are requested below. This menu must be made with a switch.

## Part II
Create a method for each of the following exercises. The method must incorporate the access qualifier "public static'' and have a name appropriate to what is requested. The method call must be made from the switch coded in the previous exercise. The methods to be coded must do the following:

1. Read 5 numbers and display them in the same order entered. The 5 numbers must be stored in an array.
2. Read out 5 numbers and display them in reverse order of entry.
3. Read 5 numbers from the keypad and then average the positive numbers, average the negative numbers and count the number of zeros entered from the keypad.
4. Receive a text as a parameter and return the number of characters in the text.
5. Receive as a parameter a text and return the inverted text.
6. Receive text as a parameter and return it without blanks.
7. Receive two strings as parameters and return them concatenated.
8. Receive a string and a vowel as a parameter, the method replaces all vowels in the string with the vowel passed as a parameter (nothing is returned).
9. Receive a string as a parameter, and display the ASCII code of each character in the string (nothing is returned by the method).
